# RL-implementations
Teaching myself RL via the interwebs and found it pretty hard to find good tutorials etc. I reccomend sentdex(youtube)/pythonprogramming.net. He showed me the light, made sense of words like 'target model' 'value model' when those words mean nothing without context. 

#Other things, like CV etc.
I will figure out a good way to lead access to the databases but for now it is just code, nothing to look at.
